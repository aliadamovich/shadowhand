# VPN sevice's landing page. [Watch it here.](aliadamovich.github.io/shadowhand/)
## In this study project I tried to implement much more Java Script code. 
#I have created adaptive burger menu, sticky header appearing on scroll, accordeon FAQ, popups and slider on vanilla JS. 
#I also used some creative animation properties for a better website appearance.
This landing page consists of 
* Menu (+ "burger" menu for dimensions up to 767px)
* Description with animation cover
* 'Subscribe us' form
* Reviews slider (realized on vanilla JS)
* 'Shop' section (grid elements)
* Popup with video (on JS)
* FAQ section (accordeon on vanilla JS)
* Footer
